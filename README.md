# A to do app by react and typescript

***

This is the address of origin project: [todoMVC-react](https://todomvc.com/examples/react/#/)

***

This is the homework when I first came into contact with react.
But at that time, I was quarantined since the COVID-19 and was in a bad mood and didn't want to study the new knowledge.
Therefore, the homework maybe could be called shit. Of course, I don't know how to use typescript at that time. So today I want to finish the homework to make up for the original pity.

After I finished this MVC, I have a lot of feelings. It's probably been three months since I started Front-end, and I can finally make something interesting with typescript. It is memorable.
